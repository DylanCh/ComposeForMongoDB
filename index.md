**Note:** Any Compose service instances that were provisioned before 14 September 2016 that are still active can still be used and directly accessed at [https://www.compose.com/](https://www.compose.com). Any Compose service instance that is provisioned from this point forward is directly accessed and used within your Bluemix account.

Complete these steps to get started with {{site.data.keyword.composeForMongoDB}}:

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.composeForMongoDB}} instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mongodb/).

   When you create an instance of the service, ensure that you choose both a name for your service and a credential name. Leave the service unbound; you can connect an application to your service later by using the credentials that are provided when the service is provisioned.  The various credential values are listed in the *Available credentials* section.

   When you provision your {{site.data.keyword.composeForMongoDB}} instance you can choose the *Standard* or *Enterprise* plans. With the *Enterprise* plan, you can provision your {{site.data.keyword.composeForMongoDB}} instance into an available {{site.data.keyword.composeEnterprise}} cluster. {{site.data.keyword.composeEnterprise}} provides the security and isolation required by enterprise compliance and uses dedicated networking to ensure the performance of the deployed databases. See the [Compose Enterprise documentation](../ComposeEnterprise/index.html) for more details.

2. Connect to your {{site.data.keyword.composeForMongoDB}} service.

   To connect an app to your service, use the [credentials](./credentials.html) that are created along with the service. The sample app demonstrates how to use Node.js to connect to a {{site.data.keyword.composeForMongoDB}} service.

   Download the [compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/compose-mongodb-helloworld-nodejs) sample app and follow the instructions in the readme file. Then, in your application details page in Bluemix, click **View APP**.
